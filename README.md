password_complexity_checker

Introduction
This Python script implements a password complexity checker that assesses the strength of user-provided passwords based on various criteria. It provides feedback to the user indicating the strength level (Strong, Good, Weak) based on the password's complexity.

Features
Evaluates password length (minimum 8 characters)
Checks for the presence of uppercase letters
Checks for the presence of lowercase letters
Checks for the presence of numbers
Checks for the presence of special characters (including !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)
Usage
Run the script:

Save the code as password_complexity_checker.py
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the command: python password_complexity_checker.py
Enter your password:

The script will prompt you to enter your password. Type your password and press Enter.
Get the feedback:

The script will analyze your password and print a message indicating its strength level (Strong, Good, Weak) on the console.
Example
Input:

Enter your password: MySecretPassword123!
Output:

Password strength: Strong
Explanation
The script defines a function password_complexity_checker that takes a password as input. It calculates a total score based on the following checks:

Length: At least 8 characters (1 point)
Uppercase letters: At least one uppercase letter (1 point)
Lowercase letters: At least one lowercase letter (1 point)
Numbers: At least one number (1 point)
Special characters: At least one special character from the specified set (1 point)
The total score determines the strength feedback:

5 points: Strong password
3-4 points: Good password
0-2 points: Weak password
Security Considerations
While this script provides basic password complexity checks, it's recommended to use more advanced password hashing and storage techniques in real-world applications.
Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for different accounts.
Additional Notes
You can expand the set of special characters allowed to include additional symbols as needed.
The minimum length and score thresholds can be adjusted to meet specific security requirements.
